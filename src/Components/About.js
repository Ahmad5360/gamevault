                  I was summoned into this pitiful mortal realm in 1991 and
                  raised by marauding wolves. Like most younglings I had grand
                  ambitions toward world domination, but as I matured and came
                  to understand more about this odd realm I realised that ruling
                  it would likely be tedious and involve far too much paperwork.
                  And so I tempered by dreams to just playing a lot of games and
                  trying not to punch every human I came across. Thus far I
                  achieved one of those dreams.
                  <br />
                  Something clearly went wrong with my summoning because I came
                  into this world with Cystic Fibrosis. It’s a bit of a pain in
                  the arse. Due to this my furry parents made the choice to
                  home-school me themselves because schools are filled with
                  viruses, and I’m a tad more vulnerable to them. Every time I
                  get one I add a bit more scarring to my lungs, although I hear
                  chicks dig scars, so maybe that’s a good thing. Plus, at the
                  tender age of 5 I was still attempting to eat most humans I
                  came across and my parents made the choice to home-school me
                  themselves because schools are filled with viruses, and I’m a
                  tad more vulnerable to them. Every time I get one I add a bit
                  more scarring to my lungs, although I hear chicks dig scars,
                  so maybe that’s a good thing. Plus, at the tender age of 5 I
                  was still attempting to eat most humans I came across and my
                  parents didn’t fancy dealing with all that faff.
                  <br />
                  Somewhere along the line my wolf parents acquired electricity
                  and a TV, and thus my first gaming memories are of a Sega
                  Genesis. What a beautiful console it was, and I spent hours
                  and hours playing the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog, Alex the
                  Kidd and Streets of Rage.

                  My four-legged father was big on technology, and so we had
                  computers fairly early on. It was on that and through my sire
                  that I learned of new games like Duke Nukem, Max Payne and
                  Total Annihilation. We used to attend to 24-hour parties where
                  I was inevitably found playing Jazz Jackrabbit on our friend’s
                  PC rather than talking to pesky human fools.
                  <br />
                  Next up was an original Playstation where I spent my time
                  playing Mortal Kombat, racing against my older brother in
                  Colin McRae Rally and running around in Grand Theft Auto 3.
                  For a long while I didn’t have a memory card, so I replayed
                  the opening hours of games over and over and over again. I
                  fell in love with the likes of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,
                  Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Matt Hoffman’s Pro BMX, Command &
                  Conquer and playing around in Music 2000.
                  <br />
                  Then came my Playstation 2, a whole new generation of games to
                  play. I remember it less, though. My truly formative time came
                  with the Xbox 360 of which I have the strongest memories. I
                  think this was the generation that truly cemented by love of
                  games. The first game I played on it was Gears of War,
                  followed by The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, a game in which I’ve
                  spent hundreds of hours over the years.
                  <br />
                  There was no eureka moment when I started writing about games.
                  It just seemed like a fun thing to do one day, and I never got
                  around to stopping. Here we are years later, and by complete
                  accident and a series of unfortunate events I’ve wound up
                  running a website all about reviewing games. For reasons
                  unknown to me, you human weirdos seem to like reading some of
                  my ramblings, and so I keep doing it. Maybe one day I’ll stop
                  and get a life. I’ve heard they are quite good.
                  <br />
                  And so the poorly named http://www.wolfsgamingblog.com was
                  born. I regret the choice of name, but at the time it was more
                  of a blog. Now that I’m fortunate enough to deal with
                  companies and get review code and hardware, the name is a bit
                  problematic because many places instantly write me off to to
                  the “blog” part. I still can’t get an article posted on N4G
                  without it being instantly reported.
                  <br />
                  My aim is to deliver the most honest reviews I can. I don’t
                  run this site for profit except for the occasion guest post
                  which I always clearly label. I try my best to deliver honest
                  opinions on whatever I play. Sometimes, those opinions agree
                  with everyone else, sometimes they don’t. Quite often they
                  deviate from the mainstream sites say.
